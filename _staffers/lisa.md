bio: I’m sooo excited to be co-teaching this course with my colleague and friend Michael Ball. I love building pathways in computing and data science education for all undergraduates. Hobbies include hiking, playing tennis/golf, cooking multi-course meals, learning languages, and reading nonfiction. If you’re interested in a career teaching CS/Data...let’s talk!
